This code implements a nested Tic Tac Toe game. The game consists of 9 Tic Tac Toe boards arranged in a 3x3 grid. Players take turns placing their symbol (X or O) on any board. A player wins the game if they win three games in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) on the meta-board.

The code defines two classes: TicTacToe and MetaTicTacToe. The TicTacToe class represents a single Tic Tac Toe game, while the MetaTicTacToe class represents the nested Tic Tac Toe game.

The TicTacToe class has the following methods:

__init__(): Initializes an empty 3x3 board.
is_full(): Returns True if the board is full, otherwise False.
reset(): Resets the board to an empty state.
block_moves(): Replaces all empty cells on the board with a '*' symbol, indicating that the game is finished.
get_winner(): Returns the winner of the game if there is one, otherwise None.
play_move(): Plays a move on the board and returns the winner and whether the board is full or not.
The MetaTicTacToe class has the following methods:

__init__(): Initializes the 3x3 meta-board with 9 TicTacToe instances.
print_meta_board(): Prints the current state of the meta-board.
get_winner(): Returns the winner of the meta-game if there is one, otherwise None.
play_move(): Plays a move on a Tic Tac Toe game within the meta-board and checks for winners and full boards.
The main() function is the entry point of the program. It initializes a MetaTicTacToe game and prompts the user to choose the type of players (Human or Computer) for both Player 1 (X) and Player 2 (O). The game loop continues until there is a winner or the meta-board is full. Players take turns making moves based on their type (Human players input their moves, and Computer players make random moves). The game ends when there is a winner or a tie, and the result is printed.

The code uses a single-threaded approach, which might be slower for large-scale games. However, this choice simplifies the code and is sufficient for the small scope of this game.
